# Creator

Inspired by a video by Kalle Hallden (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWr0mx597DnSGLFk1WfvSkQ).

I decided to automate my projects with python.

I created a script that creates different folders in different locations deppending on the type of project I want to make.

You are free to edit this and create your own version.

I already have the script prepared for design, music, web development, flutter and python.

Hope you all enjoy this project.
